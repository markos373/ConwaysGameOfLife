# Conways Game Of Life

This is an implementation of Conway's classic Game of Life.  The GUI is written in Swing, with features customizable such as thread count, board size, and simulated rounds.  The goal of this project was to analyze run-time performance on varying inputs.  A short write-up of my findings are below.
